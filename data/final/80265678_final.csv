You know that I got you like that
Ain't nobody gonna have your back
like the way I do
You love it just say you do

You know you got me
Everything you do
Everything you did
Everything I wish I was with
Makes me feel alright
I'm just saying so

I really like it 
Nothing in the world can make me feel the way 
you do the things you do
I really like it 
Nothing in the world can make me feel the way 
you do the things you do

I love you and me
Dancing in the moonlight 
Nobody can see
It's just you and me tonight
I love you and me
Dancing in the moonlight 
Nobody can see
It's just you and me tonight

Look at you now look at me
How you ever ever gonna find someone like this
Look at you now look at me
How you ever ever gonna find someone like this

You're the reason my heart skips drops
Just a little touch my world stops
Finally I know that you're mine
I don't want to fall 
Don't wanna play this game of love oh eh oh
There's nowhere to hide
 
I really like it
Nothing in the world can make me feel the way 
you do the things you do
I really like it
Nothing in the world can make me feel the way

Look at you now look at me
How you ever ever gonna find someone like this
Look at you now look at me
How you ever ever gonna find someone like this

I don't care about your first love, 
This should be your last one
Nothin' like your last one
You look better on me, that's fashion
Won't block your shot, lights camera action
Never been a love me or a love me not thing
Every petal better tell him better not change
I love you I love me a lot, wait 
Which one I love better, better off not saying 

I love you and me]"

All in the mood like 
You should put a ring on it

Don't get the blue light 
We getting nasty 
I found my new ride 
Here in the backseat 
Love so good I bet he be cashing out 
I got him feeling that rush like he passing out 
Couldn't handle these curves so he crashing now 
Beep beep with the way I can back it out

I love you and me

He knows how to get the best out of me
I'm no force for the world to see
Trade my whole life just to be
Tell nobody I control you
I broke you just to own you
They can't tell but I love you
'Cause you're loyal baby
I love when you're submissive
You love it when I break skin
You feel pain without flinchin'
So say it
Give me tough love
Leave me with nothin' when I come down
My kind of love
Force me and choke me 'til I pass out
We don't gotta be in love no
I don't gotta be the one no
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight
We don't gotta be in love no
I don't gotta be the one no
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight oh
Push me down hold me down
Spit in my mouth while you turn me out
I wanna take your light inside
Tear me down snuff me out
Hands on my neck while you push it up
And I'm screamin' now
Give me tough love
Leave me with nothin' when I come down

Until it's gone I can never find peace
Waste my whole life just to be

새침한 척 이젠 지쳐 나
귀찮아
매일 뭐 해? 어디야?
밥은? 잘 자
Baby 자기 여보 보고 싶어
다 부질없어
You got me like
이건 아무 감동 없는 Love story
어떤 설렘도 어떤 의미도
네겐 미안하지만 I'm not sorry
오늘부터 난 난 난
빛이 나는 솔로
빛이 나는 솔로
I'm going solo lo lo lo lo lo
I'm going solo lo lo lo lo lo
Used to be your girl
Now I'm used to being the goat
You're sittin' on your feelings
I'm sittin' on my throne
I ain't got no time for the troubles
In your eyes
This time I'm only lookin' at me
Myself and I
(I'm goin' solo)
I'ma do it on my own now
Now that you're alone
Got you lookin' for a clone now
(So low) that's how I'm gettin' down
Destined for this and the crown

구름 위에 별들처럼

밝게 빛나고 싶어
