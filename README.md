# K-Pop Girl Groups: An Analysis of Feminism and Empowerment (2000s-2020s)

This project delves into the evolution of concepts in K-pop girl groups, focusing on themes of feminism and empowerment over the years from 2005 to 2022. It utilizes a variety of sources such as social media, YouTube comments, song lyrics, and Google Trends for comprehensive data collection and analysis. The project encompasses multiple languages, including Korean, English, Chinese, Spanish, and Japanese.

## Hypotheses
